Space-Invaders
==============

The main idea of this code attempt was to get a game made that was of a playable quality.

The code is written in processing, which is akin to java but not 100% compatible. 

Most of the code was to be used as a starting point for a better version, but the code got large and hard to maintain.

The code is currently 2206 lines of code. this was run in processing version 2.0+ and should be compatible with most 

versions released from processing.org.
